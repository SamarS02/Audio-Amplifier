This is an Audio Amplifier split up into three stages to easilty discern them
  First Stage: Input Stage
                    -Transfers the signal from the input stage to the gain stage
  Second Stage: Gain Stage
                    -Amplifies the signal from the input to the output
  Third Stage: Output Stage
                    -Utilizes a current source mirror to then output the signal

This simulated circuit has a gain of 10
